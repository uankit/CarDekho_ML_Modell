## **1. Problem Definition**
#### The problem we will be exploring is **Regression**

#### **Statement :**
> Given Car Dekho dataset parameters , predict the price of a car



## **2. Data**
This dataset contains information about used cars listed on [***CarDekho***](https://www.cardekho.com).

The datasets have been downloaded from[ ***Kaggle*** ](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho)

The original dataset contains two (.csv) data files , which combined gives the final dataset containing 9 **features** which we'll use to predict our **target variable .**



## **3. Evaluation**


> If we can reach 97% accuracy at predicting the prices of the cars, we'll pursure this project.

However, due to the nature of experimentation, the evaluation metric may change over time.



## **4. Features**
The following are the features we'll use to predict our target variable (Price of the car)
